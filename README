AWA5x - Extended AWA5.0 implementation

Tools to compile and execute programs written in AWA5.0, with a few
extensions to make certain operations easier to reason about.

awa5 - execute compiled bytecode
awa5c - compile awatisms into bytecode
awa5p - process human-readable awatalk into awatisms

How to build:
The 'configure' script will prepare the source tree for compilation;
running Make (e.g. 'make -j') will build the above tools.

If the configure script does not exist, it can be generated using the
'autoreconf' tool, available as part of the 'Autotools' suite.

The 'awa5p' tool will be built only if the system supports regular
expressions as part of the standard C library (regex.h, regcomp,
regexec).

The built programs can be installed with 'make install'.  It will
require administrator privileges unless a user-writable path is given
through the '--prefix' option of the 'configure' script.

Important note:
Currently these tools require a UNIX-like system to work and cannot be
cross-compiled without non-trivial work.
