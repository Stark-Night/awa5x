AWA5x - Extended AWA5.0 implementation

Tools to compile and execute programs written in AWA5.0, with a few
extensions to make certain operations easier to reason about.

awa5 - execute compiled bytecode
awa5c - compile awatisms into bytecode
awa5p - process human-readable awatalk into awatisms

How to build:
It is assumed a UNIX-like environment; building has not been tested on
other systems and it will likely not work.

The 'configure' script will prepare the source tree for compilation;
running Make (e.g. 'make -j') will build the tools listed above.

If the configure script does not exist, it can be generated using the
'autoreconf' tool, available as part of the 'Autotools' suite.

The built programs can be installed with 'make install'.  It will
require administrator privileges unless a user-writable path is given
through the '--prefix' option of the 'configure' script.
