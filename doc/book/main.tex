\chapter{Preface}
Ever since joining Phase Connect as a content creator, Jelly Hoshiumi
immediately positioned herself as a unique creator among her
colleagues and, to some extent, inside the field of virtual
live-streamers.

Thanks to this uniqueness---which she maintains just by following her
interests---a just as unique community of fans gathered around her,
further creating contents taking inspiration from Jelly's own live
streams and interactions.
