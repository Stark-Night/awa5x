        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/TempTempai/AWA5.0">AWA5.0</a> is a programming language originally designed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tempflavr">Temp-Tempai</a> as a fan project based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JellyHoshiumi">Jelly Hoshiumi</a>'s content.</p>

        <p>The language features an execution model based on a single data storage (a stack of &quot;bubbles&quot;) and its syntax is very close to assembly code. This manual will not explain the language but only the tools of the awa5x suite.</p>

        <p>The awa5x tools expand on the original specifications by adding a number of convenience features, listed further in this manual.</p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="differences">
        <h1 id="differences">Differences with the original specifications</h1>

        <p>The content of this section will change as this implementation and the original specifications diverge over time.</p>

        <p>All opcodes require 8-bit parameters. In the original specifications, only the <code>BLO</code> opcode is able to handle an 8-bit value while every other operation can operate only on 5-bit values.</p>

        <p>A new <code>EQZ</code> opcode (hexadecimal code <code>0x15</code>) has been added for fast zero-equality comparisons. Originally, a program would need to push a bubble with a value of zero before being able to make a comparison, then popping the bubble before continuing execution. This opcode removes the need for both pushing and popping.</p>

        <p>The code is now compiled before being executed. The compilation is designed to make recognizing opcodes faster as the syntax is a textual representation of reset (<code>awa</code>) or set (<code>wa</code>, <code>~wa</code>) bits, so the executor can just compare bits instead of parsing text. Theoretically, it is also possible to write a compiler generating a natively executable binary instead of bytecode for a virtual machine.</p>

        <p>It is possible to write &quot;explicit comments&quot;. Normally, words which are now <em>awa</em>, <em>wa</em> or <em>~wa</em> are ignored by the compiler, however some common words like <em>away</em>, <em>awake</em> or <em>forwards</em> can confuse it. To ensure code is compiled as expected, anything between the <code>;</code> character (UTF-8 point <code>0x3B</code>) and the end of the line is completely ignored during compilation.</p>

        <p>This suite provides a tool to process a file with more human-readable directives and generate AWA5.0 source code.</p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="compiling">
        <h1 id="compiling">Compiling AWA5.0 programs</h1>

        <p>Before a program can be executed, it needs to be compiled into bytecode using the <em>awa5c</em> tool.</p>

        <p>The tool takes the file specified as a command line argument and outputs the compiled code to the standard output stream. Therefore, the most simple workflow would be as follows:</p>

        <pre>$ ed input.awa
[editing the file...]
$ awa5c input.awa > output.awc</pre>

        <p>Where <code>ed</code> is your favourite text editor.</p>

        <p>The format of the generated code can change between versions and it will not be described in this manual. Please refer to other sources if you are implementing something to process this output.</p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="executing">
        <h1 id="executing">Executing compiled AWA5.0 programs</h1>

        <p>Execution of a compiled program (see <a href="#compiling">Compiling AWA5.0 programs</a>) is performed with the <em>awa5</em> tool.</p>

        <p>The tool takes the file specified as a command line argument and iterates over the contents, executing each opcode according to the language's semantics.</p>

        <p>When the program requests user input (e.g. the <code>RED</code> opcode) the tool will block execution until either valid input is given or the process is explicitly killed. A warning message will be output by the tool to inform the user about invalid input values.</p>

        <p>Input and output are connected to the standard input and output streams. Where these streams are connected to depends on the underlying platform.</p>

        <p>Including compiling a program, a possible workflow could be as following:</p>
        <pre>$ ed input.awa
[editing the file...]
$ awa5c input.awa > output.awc
$ awa5 output.awc</pre>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="preprocessor">
        <h1 id="preprocessor">The awa5p preprocessor</h1>

        <p>The <em>awa5p</em> tool is able to process certain directives to automatically generate valid AWA5.0 programs, aiding development with various features described in this section.</p>

        <p>Each directive starting with the <code>#</code> character (UTF-8 point <code>0x23</code>) indicates an opcode and the tool will output its AWA5.0 representation, for example <code>#NOP</code> will generate <code>awa awa awa awa awa</code>.</p>

        <p>Opcode directives are case-sensitive and will silently discard any unrecognized opcode. Therefore, <code>#NOP</code> will generate AWA5.0 code, but <code>#nop</code> and <code># NOP</code> will be discarded.</p>

        <p>It is possible to recursively include other files using directives starting with the <code>&gt;</code> character (UTF-8 point <code>0x3E</code>). The name of the file to include immediately follows the directive's character.</p>

        <p>Files are searched starting from the <em>current working directory</em>. This directory is usually the place where the tool is being executed in, but it is recommended to properly set up a development environment in order to avoid having to specify absolute paths or other variable components.</p>

        <p>There is no guard against recursively including the same file multiple times. If a file <code>a.awp</code> includes <code>b.awp</code> and <code>b.awp</code> includes <code>a.awp</code>, then the tool will try to follow each directive every time each file is requested, eventually hitting the limit of per-process opened files.</p>

        <p>The most simple workflow using this tool is as following:</p>
        <pre>$ ed pre.awp
[editing the file...]
$ awa5p pre.awp > input.awa
$ awa5c input.awa > output.awc</pre>

        <p>Which can be automated for example using a Makefile:</p>
        <pre>input.awa: pre.awp
    @awa5p $< > $@

input.awc: input.awa
    @awa5c $< > $@</pre>

          <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
            functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to
            assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
            with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
            Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
            to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
            for modifications made by others.</p>

          <p>This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative
            works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
            complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
            license designed for free software.</p>

          <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
            software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
            program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
            software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
            it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
            whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
            principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p>

          <h2 id="fdl-section1">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</h2>

          <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
            contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
            distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
            world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
            work under the conditions stated herein.  The &quot;Document&quot;, below,
            refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
            licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  You accept the license if you
            copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
            under copyright law.</p>

          <p>A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the
            Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
            modifications and/or translated into another language.</p>

          <p>A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
            the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
            publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
            subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
            directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
            part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
            any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
            connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
            commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
            them.</p>

          <p>The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
            are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
            that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
            section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
            allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
            Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
            Sections then there are none.</p>

          <p>The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
            as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
            the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
            be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</p>

          <p>A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
            represented in a format whose specification is available to the
            general public, that is suitable for revising the document
            straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
            pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
            drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
            for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
            to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
            format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
            or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
            An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
            of text.  A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.</p>

          <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
            ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
            or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
            HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
            transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
            include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
            proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
            processing tools are not generally available, and the
            machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
            processors for output purposes only.</p>

          <p>The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
            plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
            this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
            formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means
            the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
            preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</p>

          <p>The &quot;publisher&quot; means any person or entity that distributes copies of
            the Document to the public.</p>

          <p>A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose
            title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
            text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
            specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
            &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.)  To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot;
            of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
            section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.</p>

          <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
            states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
            Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
            License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
            implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
            no effect on the meaning of this License.</p>

        <section aria-labelledby="fdl-section2">
          <h2 id="fdl-section2">2. VERBATIM COPYING</h2>

          <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
            commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
            copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
            to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
            other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
            technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
            copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
            compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
            number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</p>

          <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
            you may publicly display copies.</p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="fdl-section3">
          <h2 id="fdl-section3">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</h2>

          <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
            printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
            Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
            copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
            Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
            the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
            you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
            the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
            visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
            Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
            the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
            as verbatim copying in other respects.</p>

          <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
            legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
            reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
            pages.</p>

          <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
            more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
            copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
            a computer-network location from which the general network-using
            public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
            a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
            If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
            when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
            that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
            location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
            Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
            edition to the public.</p>

          <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
            Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
            give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
            Document.</p>

          <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
            the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
            the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
            Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
            and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
            of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
              from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
              (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
              of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
              if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
            </li>

            <li>B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
              responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
              Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
              Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
              unless they release you from this requirement.
            </li>

            <li>C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
              Modified Version, as the publisher.
            </li>

            <li>D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
            </li>

            <li>E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
              adjacent to the other copyright notices.
            </li>

            <li>F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
              giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
              terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
            </li>

            <li>G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
              and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
            </li>

            <li>H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
            </li>

            <li>I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add
              to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
              publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
              there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one
              stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
              given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
              Version as stated in the previous sentence.
            </li>

            <li>J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
              public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
              the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
              it was based on.  These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section.
              You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
              least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
              publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
            </li>

            <li>K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;,
              Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
              the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
              and/or dedications given therein.
            </li>

            <li>L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
              unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
              or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
            </li>

            <li>M. Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.  Such a section
              may not be included in the Modified Version.
            </li>

            <li>N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;
              or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
            </li>

            <li>O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
            appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
            copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
            of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
            list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
            These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</p>

          <p>You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains
            nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
            parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
            been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
            standard.</p>

          <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
            passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
            of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
            Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
            through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
            includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
            by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
            you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
            permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</p>

          <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
            give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
            imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="fdl-section5">
          <h2 id="fdl-section5">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</h2>

          <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
            License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
            versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
            Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
            list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
            license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</p>

          <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
            multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
            copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
            different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
            adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
            author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
            Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
            Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</p>

          <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot;
            in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
            &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
            and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;.  You must delete all sections
            Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.</p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="fdl-section6">
          <h2 id="fdl-section6">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</h2>

          <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
            documents released under this License, and replace the individual
            copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
            that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
            of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
            other respects.</p>

          <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
            distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
            copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
            License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
            document.</p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="fdl-section7">
          <h2 id="fdl-section7">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</h2>

          <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
            and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
            distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright
            resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
            of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
            When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
            apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
            derivative works of the Document.</p>

          <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
            copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
            the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
            covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
            electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
            Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
            aggregate.</p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="fdl-section8">
          <h2 id="fdl-section8">8. TRANSLATION</h2>

          <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
            distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
            Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
            permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
            translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
            original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
            translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
            Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
            the original English version of this License and the original versions
            of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
            the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
            or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</p>

          <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,
            &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
            its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
            title.</p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="fdl-section9">
          <h2 id="fdl-section9">9. TERMINATION</h2>

          <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
            except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
            otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
            will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</p>

          <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
            from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
            unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
            terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
            fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
            60 days after the cessation.</p>

          <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
            violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
            received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
            copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
            your receipt of the notice.</p>

          <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
            licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
            this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
            reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
            not give you any rights to use it.</p>

          <h2 id="fdl-section10">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</h2>

          <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
            GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
            will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
            detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.</p>

          <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
            If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
            License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of
            following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
            of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
            Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
            number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
            as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
            specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
            License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
            version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
            Document.</p>

          <h2 id="fdl-section11">11. RELICENSING</h2>

          <p>&quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&quot; (or &quot;MMC Site&quot;) means any
            World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
            provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
            public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
            &quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&quot; (or &quot;MMC&quot;) contained in the site
            means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.</p>

          <p>&quot;CC-BY-SA&quot; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
            license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
            corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
            California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
            published by that same organization.</p>

          <p>&quot;Incorporate&quot; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
            part, as part of another Document.</p>

          <p>An MMC is &quot;eligible for relicensing&quot; if it is licensed under this 
            License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
            somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
            in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
            (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.</p>

          <p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
            under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
            provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.</p>

          <p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
            the License in the document and put the following copyright and
            license notices just after the title page:</p>

          <pre>    Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.

          <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
            replace the &quot;with &hellip; Texts.&quot; line with this:</p>

          <pre>    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
